# SQLite Task Manager

Letâ€™s build a Task class capable of CRUD against a SQL table tasks.

You are given a tasks.db database with one task (id = 1), a task.rb file to complete and a test.rb to test your code.

- Implement the READ logic to find a given task (by its id)
- Implement the CREATE logic in a save instance method
- Implement the UPDATE logic in the same method
- [x] Implement the READ logic to retrieve all tasks (what type of method is it?)
- Implement the DESTROY logic on a task
